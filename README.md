# Tableland Console

The Tableland Console is a playground for the Tableland network. Use it to interact with tables on live testnet and mainnet chains.

## For users

You can check out a live deployment of the Console at: https://console.tableland.xyz

After connecting your wallet, you can see all of your owned tables, create new ones, write to them, and read table contents. All of the functionality is possible using SQL and a connection to your chain of choice.

## For developers

To get started, clone this repo, open your terminal, and run these commands:

```console
npm install
npx mix
npm start
```

By default, the Tableland Console UI will appear at port 8080.
